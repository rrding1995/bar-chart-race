# Creating a bar chart race in Matplotlib

My attempt at recreating (and potentially improving on) the Bar Chart Race template made popular by Flourish, using only standard Python packages and Matplotlib for visualisation.

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
