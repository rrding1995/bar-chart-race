# Creating a bar chart race in Matplotlib

My attempt at recreating (and potentially improving on) the Bar Chart Race template made popular by Flourish, using only standard Python packages and Matplotlib for visualisation.

## Currently includes:

- bar-chart-race.ipynb - Notebook containing all code
- Dataset for Deloitte Football Money League project

## Currently does not include: (these will be added at a later date)

- Any image files used
- File location urls in the master .ipynb notebook - please add these manually
- General functions module in a separate .py file
- Walkthrough of the code
